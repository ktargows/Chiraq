##Chiraq vs Iraq
September 2015 was rough for Chicago. After reading about a 13 year high in number of shootings, I sought context for these mind boggling numbers. I wanted to look at other big cities (so far only NYC) and other combat areas to get an angle from both the 'civilian' and 'infantry' roles.

Disclaimer, I *really* need to look at more cities and combat zones to be able to state this conclusively.

I found that while New York City is much larger than Chicago (8.5 mil vs 2.7 mil); Chicago homicides outpaced NYC's where both had completed datasets.

##### Sources & Methods

- [iCasualities.org](http://icasualties.org/OEF/Fatalities.aspx) for the U.S. casualties information. Only U.S. deaths were pulled from their website.
- The homicides were pulled from [Chicago's Open Data Portal ](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2). (Date IN '2015') and (Primary Type IS 'HOMICIDE') filters are used.
- [New York City](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-7-Major-Felony-Incidents/hyij-8hr7) also has an open portal. Similar filters are applied. Note that NYC data, at least homicides, are incomplete after September. This prevented any 1:1 over the entire 2015 until it gets filled in.
